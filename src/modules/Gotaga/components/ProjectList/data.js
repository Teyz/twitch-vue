    "concept": "ZLan is a Lan organized by the streamer Zerator. During the 2022 edition, Gotaga wanted a stream overlay that displays the logo of the game he was currently playing.",
    "description": "The project consisted in creating a react module & NodeJs express app. When you choose a game from the select, the logo on the overlay on Gotaga's stream will be updated in realtime. To make it work, I had to deal with real time events on express (SSE) because on OBS, when you integrate a browser page, simple changes won't appear on OBS.",
