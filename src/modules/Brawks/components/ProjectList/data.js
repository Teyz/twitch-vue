The guest duo is made up of either two streamers or two guests (public figures) from the same universe. The duos will compete in 6 warzone games in which they will have to face challenges to score as many points as possible and can be helped by the viewers for some missions.",
    "description": "The project consists in creating a webapp to display face-down cards in a first step. 6 cards are displayed, when clicking on one of them, it turns over and displays a challenge (Bonus / Malus etc.). The display is instantaneous on the stream.",
